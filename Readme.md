# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Objective  
Analyzed the COVID-19 dataset to understand global and regional case patterns, death rates, and country-level impacts.

## Process  
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed duplicates, filled missing numeric values with column means, and handled division-by-zero cases.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Created `Deaths per Case` column for better mortality analysis.  
- **Data Exploration:** Studied average cases per continent, global total cases, standard deviation of cases, and maximum cases by country.  
- **Data Visualization:**  
  - Histogram of total COVID-19 cases distribution.  
  - Bar chart of top 20 countries by total cases.  
- **Insights:** Identified countries with the highest COVID-19 burden, regional differences in spread, and mortality patterns.  
- **Challenges Overcome:** Dealt with missing values, inconsistent death/case ratios, and visualizing data with large country variations.  

## Files  
- `Covid-19_Analysis.csv` → Raw dataset  
- `cleaned_covid_data.csv` → Cleaned dataset  
- `covid_analysis.py` → Analysis code  
- Visualizations (plots generated during analysis)  

## Outcome  
This project improved my ability to handle global health datasets, perform feature engineering, and extract insights useful for public health monitoring and decision-making.
